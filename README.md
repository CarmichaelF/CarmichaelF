## A little bit about me: 😊

I'm a passionate Front-end Web-Developer who loves to create unique and enjoyable experiences across the internet.

I have a degree in computer science and always wanted to be a developer cause I believe that this carrer has a really unique point, in development we can build things and see their happen with a snap of fingers, that's why I love this carreer.

> I've done projects for several companies like Yamaha, Zema, Oi and others, and if you liked me I'd love to work with you :).
